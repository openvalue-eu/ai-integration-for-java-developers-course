# Different Slide Decks Available

There are several slide decks available that all incorporate the full material of the iSAQB CPSA-F training course. The
differences between the slide decks are meant to make them fit different formats in time and organization of the course
itself. This gives use more flexibility in selling the course.

The formats have a naming convention to give you an idea about the time used for that particular training setup. The
format contains the number of weeks (e.g. 1W for one week, 4W for four weeks) and the number of days (e.g. 2D for two
days, or 4D for four days). The combination of these two gives you the full format of the course, for example 4W4D is
the slide deck for the version that is spread over 4 days in 4 weeks.

These are the formats currently available:

* 4W4D - This is the regular version of the course, allowing for homework and some extra topics
* 1W4D - This is the faster version of the course, condensed in four consecutive days. This format has the exercises incorporated in the training days and thus allows for less extra topics.
* 1W2D - This is the ultra-condensed version of the course, where there are no exercises and no extra topics

The full filename of a slide deck then includes this course format, followed by the number of the day that it is meant
to be used. The 4W4D has four files, whereas the 1W2D format only has two files. A day's slide deck may be broken down
into parts. The full pattern to use for a slide deck filename is then:

```
<nr-of-weeks>W<nr-of-days>D-<nr-of-day>[-Part<nr-of-part>].<description>.adoc
```

A few examples:

```
4W4D-1-Part1.introduction.adoc
1W2D-2.design-development-and-quality-of-software-architecture.adoc
```
