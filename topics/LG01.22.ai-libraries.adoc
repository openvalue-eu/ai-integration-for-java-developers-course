=== Overview of Major Libraries

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Position each library in the ecosystem. Explain when to choose each.
--

**Three Major Java AI Libraries:**
[%step]
--
* **Deep Java Library (DJL)** - Amazon, framework-agnostic
* **Tribuo** - Oracle, traditional ML focus
* **Deeplearning4j (DL4J)** - Eclipse Foundation, deep learning
--

**Other Notable Mentions:**
[%step]
--
- Weka (traditional ML, research-oriented)
- MOA (streaming data)
- Smile (statistical ML)
--

=== Deep Java Library (DJL)

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Emphasize DJL's flexibility and production readiness. Amazon's backing is important.
--

**Key Features:**
[%step]
--
- Traditional ML algorithms (classification, regression, clustering)
- Type-safe, Java-first design
- Provenance tracking (model lineage)
- ONNX export support
- Production hardened by Oracle
--

**Best For:**
[%step]
--

- Enterprises needing Oracle support
- Tabular data problems
- Model governance requirements
--

**Supported Algorithms:**
[%step]
--
- Classification: SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest
- Regression: Linear, Ridge, Lasso
- Clustering: K-Means, DBSCAN
- Anomaly Detection
--

=== Deeplearning4j (DL4J)

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Explain DL4J's focus on deep learning and distributed training.
--

=== Library Comparison Matrix

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Show side-by-side comparison. Help participants choose based on requirements.
--

**Comparison Criteria:**
|===
| **Feature** | **DJL** | **Tribuo** | **DL4J**
| ML Type | All | Traditional | Deep Learning
| Pre-trained Models | Extensive | Limited | Moderate
| Training | Limited | Yes | Yes
| Inference | Excellent | Good | Good
| Production Ready | Yes | Yes | Yes
| Learning Curve | Low | Medium | High
| Documentation | Excellent | Good | Good
| Community | Growing | Smaller | Established

=== Discussion: Library Selection

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** 5 min discussion. Help participants think through their specific needs.
--

image::discussion-4.jpg[]

**Discussion Prompt:**
"Based on your use cases, which library seems most appropriate? What factors matter most for your team?"

**Common Concerns to Address:**
[%step]
--
- "Which is easiest to learn?" - DJL for inference, Tribuo for traditional ML
- "Which is most production-ready?" - All three, but DJL has AWS advantage
- "Can we switch libraries later?" - Yes, but costly; choose carefully
