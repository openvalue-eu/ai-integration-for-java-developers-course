**Instructor Notes:** This topic will revolve around how AI has evolved. This includes traditional development, AI-augmented development, and AI collaboration. This topic will also deal with how the role of the developer has evolved from being a producer of code, to now being a curator.

=== Automation: Era before AI (1990s-2010s)

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Set the tone of when developers relied on other development tools for increasing productivity, like Intelli-sense and static unit testing.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- IDE autocomplete: mechanical text matching
- Static analysis tools: rule-based, predefined patterns
- Limitation: couldn't learn or adapt
--


=== Augmentation: The rise of AI and Machine Learning (~2020)

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Explain what changed - massive datasets, computing power, neural network breakthroughs enabled learning from patterns.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- Training on billions of lines of code
- Pattern learning vs. rule execution
- GitHub Copilot (2021): first mainstream AI pair programmer
- Powered by OpenAI Codex
--

=== Collaboration: Present Day (2024)

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Show breadth of AI across SDLC. Emphasize paradigm shift from deterministic to probabilistic.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- AI in code generation, review, testing, documentation
- Probabilistic predictions vs. deterministic logic
- Key limitation: AI suggests likely code, not guaranteed correct
- Still requires human review and testing
--

=== The Role of Developers in an AI-Powered World

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Provide context on why AI has not completely replaced humans, but act as a tool to improve productivity. Make a point that a developer has now moved from being a code producer to being a code curator. Make sure to emphasise that even though AI can write code, a developer is still accountable for the code in Production.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- AI is a copilot rather than complete autopilot for writing code
- The responsibilities of a developer
- How the effectiveness of AI-assisted development tools often depends on the expertise of the developer
- What career prospects has emerged for software developers since AI collaboration became mainstream
--

=== Common Misconceptions
* AI "understands" code like humans do (it doesn't - it's pattern matching)
* AI is always correct if it sounds confident
* AI can replace domain expertise

=== Discussion: Your Experience

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Facilitate 3-5 min discussion. Ask about tedious tasks where AI could help.
--

**Discussion Prompt:**
"How has your development workflow evolved? What tasks are most tedious where AI assistance would be valuable?"

**Common Concerns to Address:**
[%step]
--
- "Will AI replace developers?" - No, it augments capabilities
- "Can we trust AI suggestions?" - Always review and test
- Job security fears - AI creates new opportunities
