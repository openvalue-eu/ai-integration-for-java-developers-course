=== Automation: Era before AI (1990s-2010s)

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Show timeline of tool evolution. Explain how basic autocomplete worked through text matching, no intelligence involved.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- IDE autocomplete: mechanical text matching
- Static analysis tools: rule-based, predefined patterns
- Limitation: couldn't learn or adapt
--


=== Augmentation: The rise of AI and Machine Learning (~2020)

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Explain what changed - massive datasets, computing power, neural network breakthroughs enabled learning from patterns.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- Training on billions of lines of code
- Pattern learning vs. rule execution
- GitHub Copilot (2021): first mainstream AI pair programmer
- Powered by OpenAI Codex
--

=== Collaboration: Present Day (2024)

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Show breadth of AI across SDLC. Emphasize paradigm shift from deterministic to probabilistic.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- AI in code generation, review, testing, documentation
- Probabilistic predictions vs. deterministic logic
- Key limitation: AI suggests likely code, not guaranteed correct
- Still requires human review and testing
--


=== Common Misconceptions
* AI "understands" code like humans do (it doesn't - it's pattern matching)
* AI is always correct if it sounds confident
* AI can replace domain expertise

=== Discussion: Your Experience

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Facilitate 3-5 min discussion. Ask about tedious tasks where AI could help.
--

**Discussion Prompt:**
"How has your development workflow evolved? What tasks are most tedious where AI assistance would be valuable?"

**Common Concerns to Address:**
[%step]
--
- "Will AI replace developers?" - No, it augments capabilities
- "Can we trust AI suggestions?" - Always review and test
- Job security fears - AI creates new opportunities
