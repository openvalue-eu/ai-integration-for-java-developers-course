== Topic 2: AI/ML Fundamentals for Java Developers

=== Paradigm Shift: Deterministic vs. Machine Learning
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Use familiar Java if/else example. Contrast with learning from examples.

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- Traditional: explicit rules (if/else logic)
- Machine Learning: learning patterns from examples
- Example: spam detection (rules vs. learning)
--
--
=== Types of AI
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Give a quick rundown of AI categories and comparing them. How the types of AI is grouped by capabilities and functionalities.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- AI by Capabilities:
** Narrow AI: specific tasks (e.g., code completion)
** General AI: human-like intelligence (future goal)
** Superintelligent AI: surpass human intelligence (theoretical)
- AI by Functionalities:
** Reactive Machines (Narrow AI): no memory, respond to current input (e.g., chess AI)
** Limited Memory (General AI): use past data for decisions (e.g., self-driving cars)
** Theory of Mind: understand emotions, beliefs (research stage)
** Self-Aware (Super AI): possess self-consciousness (theoretical)

=== Three Types of Machine Learning
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Use development-relevant examples for each type.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- **Supervised:** Labeled data (Copilot: comments→code)
- **Unsupervised:** Find patterns (code smell detection)
- **Reinforcement:** Trial/error with feedback (build optimization)
--

=== Large Language Models (LLMs)
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Explain at high level how LLMs generate contextually appropriate code. Show transformer architecture diagram (no math).
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- Trained on massive text/code datasets
- Predict next likely token based on context
- Dual training: natural language + programming
- Transformer architecture with attention mechanism
- Why it works: learned statistical patterns
--

=== Critical AI Limitations

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Emphasize this is most important concept for safe usage. Use examples of confident but incorrect AI suggestions.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- Probabilistic, not logical reasoning
- Can confidently generate buggy/insecure code
- Limited by training data
- No awareness of your production constraints
- Always review and test AI-generated code
--


=== Discussion: Where Can AI Help?
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Connect ML concepts to daily work. Expected insights: AI good at boilerplate, struggles with novel business logic.
--

**Discussion Prompt:**
"Where do you spend time: boilerplate, business logic, debugging, refactoring? Which would AI help most with based on how it works?"

**Common Concerns to Address:**
[%step]
--
- "Why can't AI handle complex business logic?" - Limited by training data patterns
- "Is AI just guessing?" - Yes, probabilistic predictions based on learned patterns
- "When should we not use AI?" - Novel problems, security-critical code without review
