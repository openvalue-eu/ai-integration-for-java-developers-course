=== Tokenization and Vocabulary
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Explain the basics on how text/code is broken into tokens for processing, what vocabulary means in this context.
 It would be helpful to show examples of tokenization for natural language and code.

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- Explain what tokens are (words, subwords, characters)
- Understand that each model has its own tokenization method
- How tokens differ for natural language, including the advantages of subword tokenization
- Why do we use tokenization over raw text?
- Understand how vocabulary is built from tokens
- Know how vocabulary size impacts model performance

=== Types of AI
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Give a rundown of AI categories and comparing them. How the types of AI is grouped by capabilities and functionalities.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- AI by Capabilities:
** Narrow AI: specific tasks (e.g., code completion)
** General AI: human-like intelligence (future goal)
** Superintelligent AI: surpass human intelligence (theoretical)
- AI by Functionalities:
** Reactive Machines (Narrow AI): no memory, respond to current input (e.g., chess AI)
** Limited Memory (General AI): use past data for decisions (e.g., self-driving cars)
** Theory of Mind: understand emotions, beliefs (research stage)
** Self-Aware (Super AI): possess self-consciousness (theoretical)

=== Types of Machine Learning
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Use development-relevant examples for each type.

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- **Supervised:** Labeled data (Copilot: comments → code)
** Examples: classification, regression
- **Unsupervised:** Find patterns (code smell detection)
** Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning
- **Reinforcement:** Trial/error with feedback (build optimization)
** Examples: positive/negative rewards

=== The difference Between AI and ML
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Emphasize how deep learning is a subset of ML, which is a subset of AI. Event though deep learning isn't in the topic header, doesn't mean that it doesn't play a crucial role. AI and ML are related, but they are not interchangeable terms.

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- AI: broad field of simulating human intelligence
- ML: subset of AI using data to learn patterns
- Deep Learning: subset of ML using neural networks with many layers
- Understand the difference between AI engineering and ML engineering
--

=== Large Language Models (LLMs)
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Explain at high level how LLMs generate contextually appropriate code. Explain the two kinds of language models (Masked, and Autoregressive).
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- Trained on massive text/code datasets
- Predict next likely token based on context
- Explain what masked language models are.
- Explain what autoregressive models are.
- What are the comparisons between masked, and autoregressive  models and how they use tokens differently.
--

=== Critical AI Limitations

[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Emphasize this is the most important concept for safe usage. Use examples of confident but incorrect AI suggestions.
--

**Key Points to Cover:**
[%step]
--
- Probabilistic, not logical reasoning
- Can confidently generate buggy/insecure code
- Limited by training data
- No awareness of your production constraints
- Always review and test AI-generated code
--

=== When to use AI and when to avoid it
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Provide practical guidelines for developers.
--

**Key Guidelines:**
[%step]
--
- Use for boilerplate, repetitive tasks
- Avoid for complex business logic
- Always review for security, correctness
- Combine with traditional development practices
- Prefer human oversight for critical systems
-
--

=== Discussion: Where Can AI Help?
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Expected insights: AI good at boilerplate, struggles with novel business logic.
--

**Discussion Prompt:**
"Where do you spend time: boilerplate, business logic, debugging, refactoring? Which would AI help most with based on how it works?"

**Common Concerns to Address:**
[%step]
--
- "Why can't AI handle complex business logic?" - Limited by training data patterns
- "Is AI just guessing?" - Yes, probabilistic predictions based on learned patterns
- "When should we not use AI?" - Novel problems, security-critical code without review
