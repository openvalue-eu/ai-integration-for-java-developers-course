== Topic 3: Overview of AI-Assisted Development Tools

=== Tool Landscape
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Show tool categories. Explain different tools solve different problems.
--

**Key Categories:**
[%step]
--
- Code generation & completion
- Code review & quality
- Testing & test generation
- Documentation & knowledge
--

=== Code Generation Tools
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Highlight Copilot as next module's focus. Mention alternatives and their differentiators.
--

**Key Tools:**
[%step]
--
- GitHub Copilot (most popular, Codex-based)
- Tabnine (privacy-focused, on-premise)
- Amazon CodeWhisperer (AWS integration)
- Cursor (AI-first IDE)
--

=== Code Review & Quality Tools
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Explain how these differ from traditional static analysis - they learn patterns, not just check rules.
--

**Key Tools:**
[%step]
--
- DeepCode/Snyk (security vulnerabilities)
- Amazon CodeGuru (performance + AWS best practices)
- CI/CD pipeline integration
--

=== Testing Tools
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Show how AI generates meaningful tests, not just templates. Understands code semantics.
--

**Key Tools:**
[%step]
--
- Diffblue Cover (automated unit tests for Java)
- Applitools (visual regression testing)
- Edge case generation
--

=== Documentation Tools
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Explain automation of tedious documentation work.
--

**Key Tools:**
[%step]
--
- Copilot/CodeWhisperer for Javadoc
- Automated architecture docs
- Natural language code search
--

=== Demo: GitHub Copilot in Action
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** 5-7 min live demo in IntelliJ with Spring Boot project.
--

**Demo Steps:**
[%step]
--
1. Comment-driven development: write service method comment, show suggestion
2. Generate unit test for the method
3. Generate Javadoc comments
4. Refactor for readability
--

=== Tool Selection Criteria
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Help participants think through what matters for their organization.
--

**Key Factors:**
[%step]
--
- Security/compliance (code privacy)
- Integration with existing toolchain
- Learning curve and team readiness
- Cost vs. value (ROI)
- Deployment model (cloud vs. on-premise)
--

=== Discussion: Selection Strategy
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** 2-3 min discussion. Address common concerns proactively to remove adoption barriers.
--

**Discussion Prompt:**
"What factors are most important for your organization? What concerns might prevent AI tool adoption?"

**Common Concerns to Address:**
[%step]
--
- **Security:** "Will our code leave the organization?" - Depends on tool, some offer on-premise (Tabnine)
- **Cost:** "Too expensive for large teams?" - Pilot first, measure ROI
- **Integration:** "Will it work with our stack?" - Check compatibility before commitment
- **Resistance:** "AI will replace developers?" - Augmentation not replacement, creates new opportunities
- **Quality:** "Can we trust AI suggestions?" - Always review, use as assistant not authority
