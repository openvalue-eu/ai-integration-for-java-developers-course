== Topic 5: Limitations and Best Practices

=== When Copilot Struggles
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Show real examples of poor suggestions. Teach critical evaluation.
--

**Common Issues:**
[%step]
--
- Novel business logic not in training data
- Domain-specific algorithms
- Complex state management
- Subtle security vulnerabilities
- Deprecated API usage
--

=== Security Considerations
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Reference security research paper on AI-generated code vulnerabilities.
--

**Key Risks:**
[%step]
--
- SQL injection in dynamic queries
- Missing input validation
- Insecure deserialization
- Hard-coded credentials
- Weak cryptography choices
--

**Best Practices:**
[%step]
--
- Always review generated code
- Run security scanning tools (Snyk, SonarQube)
- Never blindly accept authentication/authorization code
- Validate all inputs, even in Copilot-generated code
--

**Common Concerns to Address:**
[%step]
--
- "How often does Copilot suggest insecure code?" - Studies show ~40% in security-critical scenarios
- "Can we trust Copilot for security-sensitive features?" - No, always require expert review
- "Should we use Copilot for payment processing?" - Yes, but with rigorous review and testing
--

=== Code Quality Checks
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Emphasize that AI is assistant, not authority.
--

**Required Checks:**
[%step]
--
- Code review by senior developers
- Static analysis (SonarQube, SpotBugs)
- Unit test coverage
- Integration testing
- Security scanning
--

=== Performance Considerations
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Show examples of functionally correct but inefficient code.
--

**Watch For:**
[%step]
--
- N+1 query problems in JPA
- Inefficient collections usage
- Missing database indexes
- Unnecessary object creation
- Blocking operations in async contexts
--

=== Legal and Licensing Concerns
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** Brief overview of intellectual property considerations.
--

**Key Points:**
[%step]
--
- Copilot trained on public repositories
- Some code may match training data closely
- GitHub's position on copyright
- Your organization's policies
- When to check suggestions against public code
--

**Common Concerns to Address:**
[%step]
--
- "Could we violate someone's copyright?" - Possible but rare; check similar code
- "Who owns AI-generated code?" - Your organization, per GitHub's terms
- "Should we disclose AI usage?" - Check your org's policies
--

=== Discussion: Governance and Guidelines
[.notes]
--
**Instructor Notes:** 5 min discussion. Help participants think through team policies.
--

**Discussion Prompt:**
"What guidelines should your team establish for using Copilot? Who reviews AI-generated code? What's prohibited?"

**Common Concerns to Address:**
[%step]
--
- "Do we need approval before using Copilot?" - Depends on organization
- "Should we track which code came from AI?" - Consider for audit purposes
- "Can junior developers use Copilot unsupervised?" - Requires senior review
--
