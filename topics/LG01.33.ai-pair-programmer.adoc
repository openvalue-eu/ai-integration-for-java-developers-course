=== Chat Pattern: Code Explanation

**Scenario:** Understanding unfamiliar code

```java
// Select complex code, then:
// Chat: "/explain What does this Stream pipeline do?"

return orders.stream()
    .filter(o -> o.getStatus() == OrderStatus.PENDING)
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
        Order::getCustomerId,
        Collectors.summingDouble(Order::getTotal)
    ));
```

**Copilot Explains:**

* Filters for pending orders
* Groups by customer
* Sums order totals per customer
* Returns Map<CustomerId, Total>

=== Chat Pattern: Debugging

**Scenario:** Tracking down a bug

```
You: This method throws ConcurrentModificationException.
     Why and how do I fix it?

Copilot: The exception occurs because you're modifying
         the list while iterating. Here are 3 solutions:
         1. Use Iterator.remove()
         2. Create a copy for iteration
         3. Use streams with filter

         [Shows code examples for each]
```

**Best Practice:** Provide error messages and context

=== Chat Pattern: Refactoring Assistance

**Example Dialog:**

```
You: How can I refactor this 200-line method?

Copilot: I see several opportunities:
1. Extract validation into separate method
2. Move business logic to service layer
3. Use Strategy pattern for payment processing
4. Extract constants for magic numbers

Would you like me to show refactoring for any of these?

You: Show me the Strategy pattern refactoring

Copilot: [Generates PaymentStrategy interface and implementations]
```

Emphasize: Copilot helps identify patterns

=== Chat Pattern: Learning New Concepts

**Scenario:** Understanding Spring Boot features

```
You: Explain @Transactional propagation in Spring Boot.
     Give examples of when to use REQUIRED vs REQUIRES_NEW

Copilot: [Provides explanation with code examples]

You: Show me a scenario where REQUIRES_NEW prevents
     data inconsistency

Copilot: [Creates concrete example with banking transaction]
```

**Use Chat as:** Tutor, reference, example generator

=== Advanced Chat Techniques

**1. Context References**
```
Chat: @workspace How do we handle authentication in this project?
```
*Searches all project files*

**2. Multi-turn Refinement**
```
You: Create a product service
Copilot: [generates basic service]
You: Add caching with 5-minute TTL
Copilot: [adds @Cacheable]
You: Include cache invalidation on updates
Copilot: [adds @CacheEvict]
```

[.notes]
--
@workspace is powerful for project-specific questions
--

**3. Architectural Questions**
```
You: What's the best way to implement rate limiting
     in this Spring Boot app? Consider we're using Redis.

Copilot: I recommend using Spring AOP with Redis:
         [Shows interceptor approach with code]

         Alternatively, you could use Bucket4j:
         [Shows Bucket4j configuration]

         For your use case, AOP approach is simpler because
         you already have Redis configured.
```

**4. Framework-Specific Guidance**
```
You: Show me the Spring Boot 3 way to configure
     security for JWT authentication
```
