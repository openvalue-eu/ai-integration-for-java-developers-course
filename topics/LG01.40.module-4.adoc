== Module Summary

**Instructor Notes:** Recap key concepts. Emphasize practical application.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Java has mature ML libraries (DJL, Tribuo, DL4J)
- Pre-trained models are easiest starting point
- Inference in Java is production-ready
- Choose library based on use case
- ML integration follows standard Java patterns

**Skills Developed:**
- ✓ Understanding ML fundamentals
- ✓ Setting up Java AI libraries
- ✓ Using pre-trained models for inference
- ✓ Building AI-enhanced REST APIs
- ✓ Choosing appropriate libraries

**Best Practices:**
- Start with pre-trained models
- Profile performance in production
- Handle ML errors gracefully
- Monitor predictions
- Keep models updated

**Common Concerns Addressed:**
- "Too complex?" - Pre-trained models abstract complexity
- "Performance?" - Inference is fast enough for most apps
- "Which library?" - Depends on use case (DJL for inference, Tribuo for traditional ML)

**Next Module:** Building your first AI-enhanced Java application (hands-on workshop)
